# zk-Rollup Blueprint

zk-Rollups are one of the most important breakthroughs in blockchain scalability.  
They combine off-chain computation with on-chain verification using zero-knowledge proofs — allowing thousands of transactions to be processed securely and privately.

This repository aims to be a clear and concise blueprint to understand:
- The technology behind zk-Rollups  
- The main Layer 2 ecosystems using zk proofs  
- The trade-offs between scalability, security, and decentralization  
- The social and philosophical implications of a world where “proof replaces trust”

## 🤝 Contribution

This repo is open to researchers, developers, and curious minds.  
You can open issues, propose edits, or submit reflections.  
The goal is not just to document zk-Rollups — it’s to think about what they *mean*.
